    <p>So close, no matter how far <br>
        Couldn't be much more from the heart <br>
        Forever trusting who we are <br>
        And nothing else matters <br>
        <br>
        Never opened myself this way <br>
        Life is ours, we live it our way <br>
        All these words, I don't just say <br>
        And nothing else matters <br>
        <br>
        Trust I seek and I find in you <br>
        Every day for us something new <br>
        Open mind for a different view <br>
        And nothing else matters <br>
        <br>
        Never cared for what they do <br>
        Never cared for what they know <br>
        But I know <br>
        <br>
        So close, no matter how far <br>
        It couldn't be much more from the heart <br>
        Forever trusting who we are <br>
        And nothing else matters <br>
        <br>
        Never cared for what they do <br>
        Never cared for what they know <br>
        But I know <br>
        <br>
        I never opened myself this way <br>
        Life is ours, we live it our way <br>
        All these words, I don't just say <br>

        And nothing else matters <br>
        <br>
        Never cared for what they say <br>
        Never cared for games they play <br>
        Never cared for what they do <br>
        Never cared for what they know <br>
        And I know, yeah, yeah <br>
        <br>
        So close, no matter how far <br>
        Couldn't be much more from the heart <br>
        Forever trusting who we are <br>
        No, nothing else matters</p>
